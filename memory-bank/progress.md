# Progress: Personalized News and Content Curator

## 1. What Works

-   **Core Workflow**: The end-to-end process of fetching news, summarizing articles, generating a PDF, and sending an email is functional.
-   **News Fetching**: The `news-fetcher` tool successfully retrieves articles from the Google News RSS feed for a given topic.
-   **Article Summarization**: The integration with the `@juspay/neurolink` AI provider is working, and article summaries are being generated.
-   **PDF Generation**: The `pdf-generator` module correctly creates a formatted PDF with the curated content.
-   **Email Delivery**: The "email" MCP server is capable of sending emails with attachments using `nodemailer`.
-   **MCP Integration**: The main application can communicate with the "news" and "email" MCP servers to orchestrate the workflow.

## 2. What's Left to Build

-   **Robust Error Handling**: The current error handling is basic. More sophisticated error handling is needed to make the application more resilient.
-   **Improved Logging**: The logging is primarily for debugging purposes. A more structured and comprehensive logging strategy is needed for monitoring and production support.
-   **User-Friendly Interface**: The application currently runs as a command-line tool. A web-based or graphical user interface would make it more accessible to non-technical users.
-   **User Profiles**: There is no mechanism for saving user preferences. A user profile system would allow users to save their topics of interest and email address.
-   **Scalability Enhancements**: The current MCP server implementation is not scalable. Refactoring the MCP servers to run as long-lived, independent services is a key next step for improving performance and scalability.
-   **Expanded Content Sources**: The application currently only supports Google News. Adding support for other content sources would make the application more versatile.

## 3. Current Status

The project is at a "proof-of-concept" stage. The core functionality is in place, but the application requires further development to be considered production-ready. The immediate priority is to improve the robustness and reliability of the existing features.

## 4. Known Issues

-   **MCP Server Scalability**: The `exec`-based approach for running MCP servers is inefficient and does not scale well.
-   **Potential for Unhandled Errors**: There may be edge cases in the workflow (e.g., network failures, API errors) that are not currently handled gracefully.
-   **Hardcoded Configurations**: Some configurations, such as the five-article limit in the `news-fetcher`, are hardcoded. These should be made configurable.
-   **Lack of Input Validation**: The application performs minimal validation on user input. More robust validation is needed to prevent errors.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions

-   **Initial Design**: The project started with a monolithic design, with all logic contained in a single script.
-   **Adoption of MCP**: The decision was made to adopt the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to decouple the core application logic from the external services. This led to the creation of the "news" and "email" MCP servers.
-   **Introduction of TypeScript**: The project was migrated to TypeScript to improve code quality and maintainability.
-   **Focus on Core Workflow**: The development effort has been focused on getting the end-to-end workflow operational, with the understanding that further refinement and feature development would follow.
