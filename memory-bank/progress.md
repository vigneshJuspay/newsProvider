# Progress: Personalized News and Content Curator

## 1. What Works

*   The project's foundational documentation (memory bank) has been created. This provides a clear and consistent source of truth for the project's goals, context, and technical direction.

## 2. What's Left to Build

*   The entire application needs to be built in TypeScript. This includes:
    *   Setting up the Node.js and TypeScript environment.
    *   Installing the `@juspay/neurolink` library.
    *   Implementing the AI agent.
    *   Creating the `WebSearch`, `RSS_Reader`, and `SocialMedia` tools.
    *   Developing the content processing and summarization logic.
    *   Building the delivery mechanism for the daily briefing.

## 3. Current Status

*   **Phase:** Project Re-Initialization
*   **Progress:** The project is being pivoted to a TypeScript-based implementation. The memory bank has been updated to reflect this change. The next step is to set up the Node.js project structure.

## 4. Known Issues

*   None at this time.
