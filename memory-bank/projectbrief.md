# Project Brief: Personalized News and Content Curator (NeuroLink)

## 1. Project Overview

This project, codenamed "NeuroLink," is a personalized intelligence analyst designed to curate news and content from various online sources. It aims to solve the problem of information overload by filtering, summarizing, and delivering relevant content based on user-defined interests.

## 2. Core Problem

It is challenging for individuals to stay updated with the vast amount of information published daily across news sites, blogs, and social media. Sifting through this noise to find content relevant to one's personal or professional interests is time-consuming and inefficient.

## 3. The NeuroLink Solution

NeuroLink will be an AI-powered agent that automates the process of content discovery and curation. The system will provide a streamlined and personalized content experience, delivering a daily briefing of the most important information.

### Key Features:

1.  **Configuration:** The application will prompt the user to specify their topics of interest.
2.  **Continuous Monitoring:** An agent will continuously scan the web using a `WebSearch` tool, an `RSS_Reader` tool, and a `SocialMedia` tool to find new content matching the user's criteria.
3.  **Intelligent Filtering and Summarization:** The system will process the collected content to:
    *   Filter out duplicates and low-quality articles.
    *   Identify content the user has already seen.
    *   Group related articles by topic.
    *   Generate a one-paragraph summary for each topic group.
4.  **Daily Briefing:** The curated and summarized content will be delivered each morning as a personalized daily briefing, accessible via email or a private webpage.

## 4. Technical Direction

The project will be built using the `juspay/neurolink` framework, which is expected to provide the core components for agent creation, tool integration, and content processing.
