# Project Brief: Personalized News and Content Curator

## 1. Overview

This project, the "Personalized News and Content Curator," is a Node.js application designed to deliver tailored news briefings to users. It fetches articles from various sources based on user-defined topics, generates a summarized PDF report, and emails it to the user. The system is architected with a modular design, using MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to handle distinct functionalities like news aggregation and email notifications.

## 2. Core Problem

The modern digital landscape is saturated with information, making it challenging for users to stay updated on their specific interests without being overwhelmed. This project aims to solve this problem by providing a personalized, curated news experience that filters out noise and delivers relevant content in a convenient format.

## 3. Key Objectives

- **Personalization**: Allow users to specify topics of interest to tailor the content they receive.
- **Automation**: Automate the process of fetching, summarizing, and delivering news briefings.
- **Convenience**: Deliver the curated news in a portable and easily readable PDF format directly to the user's email.
- **Modularity**: Build the system with a decoupled architecture using MCP servers to ensure scalability and maintainability.
- **Extensibility**: Design the system to be easily extendable with new content sources, summarization models, and delivery channels.

## 4. Target Audience

The primary audience for this application is individuals who want to stay informed on specific topics but lack the time to sift through numerous news outlets. This includes professionals, researchers, students, and hobbyists.
