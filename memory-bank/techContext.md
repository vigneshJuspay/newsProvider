# Tech Context: Personalized News and Content Curator

## 1. Core Technology

*   **Framework:** The project will be built using the `@juspay/neurolink` TypeScript library. This framework is expected to provide the foundational components for creating the AI agent, managing tools, and orchestrating the content processing pipeline.

## 2. Tools and Integrations

The agent will utilize a suite of tools to gather information:

*   **`WebSearch` Tool:** A generic web search tool to find articles and blog posts. The specific implementation will be determined based on the capabilities of the `neurolink` framework.
*   **`RSS_Reader` Tool:** A tool to subscribe to and parse RSS feeds.
*   **`SocialMedia` Tool:** A tool to monitor social media platforms. The initial focus will be on Twitter, with potential expansion to other platforms.

## 3. Development and Deployment

*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Dependency Management:** Project dependencies will be managed using `package.json` and `npm` or `yarn`.
*   **Environment:** The application will be developed to run in a Node.js environment.
*   **Delivery Mechanism:** The daily briefing will be delivered via email and/or a simple, locally-hosted webpage. The specifics of this will be determined as the project progresses.
