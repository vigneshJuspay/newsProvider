# Active Context: Personalized News and Content Curator

## 1. Current Focus

The immediate focus is on ensuring the stability and reliability of the core workflow: fetching news, summarizing articles, generating a PDF, and sending the email. This involves robust error handling, clear logging, and ensuring all components interact seamlessly.

## 2. Recent Changes

-   The memory bank has been completely rebuilt to reflect the current state of the codebase and establish a clear, industry-standard documentation structure.
-   The codebase has been thoroughly analyzed to create the new memory bank, providing a deep understanding of the system's architecture, patterns, and technologies.

## 3. Next Steps

-   **Refine Error Handling**: Improve the error handling in `main.ts` to provide more user-friendly messages and ensure that the application exits gracefully when a critical error occurs.
-   **Enhance Logging**: Implement more detailed logging throughout the application to facilitate debugging and monitoring. This includes adding more context to log messages in the MCP servers and the main application.
-   **Improve PDF Layout**: Enhance the design of the generated PDF to improve readability and visual appeal. This could include adding a table of contents, improving the layout of articles, and adding more branding elements.
-   **Add Configuration for News Sources**: Abstract the news fetching logic to allow for the addition of new news sources beyond Google News. This would likely involve creating a more generic `NewsFetcher` interface and implementing different strategies for each source.

## 4. Active Decisions and Considerations

-   **MCP Server Communication**: The current implementation of `executeMCPCommand` uses `exec` to run the MCP servers as short-lived processes. For a more scalable solution, these should be refactored to run as long-lived, independent services, and the communication mechanism should be updated accordingly (e.g., using HTTP requests or a message queue).
-   **AI Provider Selection**: The use of `createBestAIProvider` is convenient, but for a production system, it would be beneficial to explicitly configure and select the AI model to ensure consistent performance and cost management.
-   **Dependency Management**: The project relies on several external dependencies. It is important to keep these dependencies up-to-date and to be aware of any potential security vulnerabilities.

## 5. Key Learnings and Insights

-   The modular architecture based on MCP servers is a significant strength of the project, as it promotes separation of concerns and makes the system easier to maintain and extend.
-   The use of TypeScript provides strong guarantees about the shape of the data flowing through the system, which is particularly valuable in a multi-component architecture.
-   The current implementation is a solid foundation, but there are clear opportunities for improvement in terms of robustness, scalability, and user experience.
