## 1. Current Focus

The immediate focus is on pivoting the project to TypeScript and setting up the new environment. This involves:

*   Updating the memory bank to reflect the technology change.
*   Initializing a Node.js project.
*   Investigating the `@juspay/neurolink` npm package.

## 2. Next Steps

1.  **Initialize Node.js Project:** Create a `package.json` file to manage dependencies.
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Install `typescript`, `@types/node`, and `@juspay/neurolink`.
3.  **Explore `@juspay/neurolink`:** Fetch and analyze the documentation from the provided npm URL to understand its API and usage patterns.
4.  **Initial Scaffolding:** Create a `src/main.ts` file to begin the application implementation.
5.  **Tool Implementation (Proof of Concept):** Implement a basic version of one of the tools (e.g., `WebSearch`) in TypeScript.

## 3. Key Decisions & Patterns

*   **Documentation First:** The memory bank will be kept up-to-date to ensure a consistent understanding of the project state.
*   **Iterative Development:** The application will be built incrementally, starting with a simple agent and one tool, and then expanding its capabilities.
